     My favorite sports pub serves this, 
     and I've come up with a simple and delicious home version.
     Many local restaurants sell wing sauce, and most grocery stores
  </p>

   <p>
     carry it near the steak and BBQ sauces. It's rich, so serve in 
     squares as an appetizer. Serve ranch dressing, celery, and carrot sticks on the side.
     Enjoy!
